## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Notes:
1. **Timezone**: All times use Nepal timezone (Asia/Kathmandu)

4. **Past dates**: Admin can still create for corrections
5. **Lunch Manager**: Equal to Admin for lunch module only

7. **One request per record**: Cannot re-request after rejection

### Limitations:
- Timing configuration is global (not per employee or department)

- Time validation uses Nepal timezone (hardcoded)
- Email sending limited by SMTP server rate limits
- Excel import requires exact employee name match
- Saturday is hardcoded as holiday
- Cannot edit confirmed lunch (by design)
- Activities sent to all admins/managers (not individually assignable)
